# Spring Boot Guava Cache Demo

#### This is a simple demo application to accompany my tutorial on caching with Spring and Guava

Installation:

`mvn clean install`

Then start the server as follows:
```
cd target

java -jar caching-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This will start a tomcat server on port 8080 and intialize an in-memory H2 database with a number of postal codes for testing (see import.sql)

Invoke the REST API from your browser (or other client) as follows

The temperature API takes a valid Dutch postcode (4 digits, 2 letters)

`http://localhost:8080/temperature/1000AA`

The shares API takes a valid share name as listed in nl.jsprengers.caching.Shares

`http://localhost:8080/share/FACEBOOK`
